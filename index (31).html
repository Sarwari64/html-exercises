Our ranch is pesticide and chemical fertilizer free.

Our cattle and sheep are never grain fed or given synthetic hormones or antibiotics.

No genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

Raised on a family ranch.

Cattle are not put in feedlots and only finished on grasslands.

Fed only the forage the range provides.

Our grazing methods improve the biodiversity of the land.

By stimulating grassland health through our Holistic Context, carbon is captured in the soil and watersheds are regenerated.

Our Philosophy in grazing is to manage the cattle herd to simulate the large herds of Elk and Antelope which once roamed 
California’s grasslands. We accomplish this by keeping the herd moving with Holistic planned grazing, so as never to
 overgraze an area, but rather to stimulate growth and grass-land health through properly timed grazing. Watershed
 Stewardship is at the forefront of our management practices.

Health Benefits of Choosing Grass-Fed. Meat and dairy products from pastured animals are ideal for your health. 
Compared with commercial products, they offer you more "good" fats, and fewer "bad" fats. They are richer in
 antioxidants; including vitamins E, beta-carotene, and vitamin C. Furthermore, they do not contain traces of
 added hormones, antibiotics or other drugs. Find out more at Eat Wild.

Audubon Certified -Bird Friendly Land.

Markegard Family Ranch is the first ranch in California to become Audubon certified as “Bird Friendly”
 land. We are proud of this label and committed to ranching in such a way that is restorative to bird habitats and our  grasslands.
